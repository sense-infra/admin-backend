## üîê Authentication Notes

- All customer endpoints require a valid JWT via `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- Tokens expire based on server policy (e.g., 1‚Äì24 hours)
- On logout, sessions are deleted and token is no longer valid
- Passwords are securely stored using bcrypt
- Customers must change password on first login if `force_password_change` is true
